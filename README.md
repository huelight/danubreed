# Week 5 Assignment Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions to the Week 5 assignment, which covers Randomization and Lists in Python. The assignment is divided into multiple parts, each containing individual tasks. The solutions are organized into folders for easy access and review.

## Folder Structure

- **Part_1/**  
  Contains solutions related to randomization.
  
  - **task_1.py**  
    Solution to **Task 1: Dice Roller Simulation**  
    - This script simulates rolling two six-sided dice and prints the total of the rolls.
  
  - **task_2.py**  
    Solution to **Task 2: Random Meal Selector**  
    - This script randomly selects a meal plan for the day, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
  
  - **task_3.py**  
    Solution to **Task 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
    - This script lets the user play a Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer.

- **Part_2/**  
  Contains solutions related to list operations.
  
  - **task_4.py**  
    Solution to **Task 4: Favorite Foods List**  
    - This script demonstrates various list operations like appending, inserting, removing, reversing, and sorting items in a list.
  
  - **task_5.py**  
    Solution to **Task 5: Random Name Selector**  
    - This script collects names of friends and randomly selects one as the "winner."

- **Part_3/**  
  Contains the solution to the combined task which involves both randomization and lists.
  
  - **task_6.py**  
    Solution to **Task 6: Random Team Generator**  
    - This script takes a list of people's names, randomly shuffles them, and splits them into two teams.

## How to Access and Run the Solutions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Navigate to the folder containing the solution files using the terminal or file explorer.

2. **Navigate Through Folders:**
   - Open the `Part_1`, `Part_2`, or `Part_3` folder to find the task solution files (`task_1.py`, `task_2.py`, etc.).

3. **Run the Solution Files:**
   - Open the desired Python file (e.g., `task_1.py`) in Visual Studio Code or any Python IDE.
   - Run the file to see the solution in action.
   - You can also run the Python files directly from the terminal using the command:
     ```bash
     python path/to/file.py
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python Part_1/task_1.py
     ```

## Additional Notes

- Each solution file contains comments explaining the steps and logic used to solve the task.
- You can modify the code to explore and experiment with different scenarios and options.

Feel free to explore each part and task to understand how to implement different concepts using Python. Happy coding!
